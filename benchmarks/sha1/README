We assume that the memory is aligned to 4 byte that's why you see idx*4.


DFG info

Black nodes are instructions.
Labels in those nodes start with the ID of the node and are followed by the corresponding 
LLVM instruction when available.
Sometimes is possible to merge together some instruction since our ISA is capable of doing 
so.


Green nodes are constants.

Red nodes are live-in variables.

Blue nodes are live-out variables;

Labels in Green, Red and Blue nodes only contains the Node ID, their value can be found out 
by looking at the destination Node.
Those nodes are not included in the DFG file that contains all the edges.



PE info


4x4 CGRA with cross topology

Numbering convention:
 -----------------------
|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |
|-----------------------|
|  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
|-----------------------|
|  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |
|-----------------------|
|  12 | 13  | 14  | 15  |
 -----------------------

For example: PE 8 can take data from the neighbour PE 12, 9, 4, 11



PHI nodes

Phi nodes are translated as move operation.
In the assembly you will find MV 0, RCR -> Rout that reads as " Move the value in the output register of the right PE into the output register of this PE"
This instruction is not available in the IS provided, but can be implemented as an ADD operation.
ADD RCR, 0 -> Rout.
